### What it does
Near is a comprehensive OSINT toolkit designed to consolidate essential open-source intelligence gathering capabilities into a single terminal user interface.

### Why
Near was born from the need to consolidate multiple OSINT tools into a single toolkit. It simplifies the workflow by removing the need to manage multiple tools, while also providing a personal space to experiment with and learn modern OSINT techniques.

### Installation

### Prerequisites
- Git  
- Python 3 (version 3.6 or higher recommended)  
- pip 

### Initial setup

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt  
```

### Running from source

```
python3 near.py
```

### Usage

Once the program is launched, you will see an interface presenting a variety of tools. Letâ€™s explore each of them in detail.

### Scan Username
The Scan Username tool performs a multi-threaded search to quickly check the existence of a username across multiple social platforms. A demonstration of this feature is shown [at the beginning](#top) of this README file.

### Social Scraper
The Social Scraper provides an interface to scrape basic information from various social media platforms.
